# Numerical Computing Methods and Rules
This Repository contains programs of Numerical Computing methods & rules in Matlab, which contains programs of Cholesky and Dolittle method as well as Simpson & Trapezoidal rule for better understanding the computing procedures.
  
## Features
- Cholesky Method: Factorization is done by using Kruskal's algorithm.
- Dolittle Method: Factorization is done by using Prim's algorithm.
- Simpson Rule: Numerical Integration is done by using Simpson's Rule.
- Trapezoidal Rule: Numerical Integration is done by using Trapezoidal's Rule.
